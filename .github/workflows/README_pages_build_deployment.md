The pages-build-deployment action is a built-in GitHub Actions workflow that is automatically triggered by GitHub Pages. 

It is not defined in the .github/workflows directory of your repository. Instead, it is managed
by GitHub itself to handle the deployment of your GitHub Pages site. 

This action is configured and managed by GitHub, and you do not need to define it manually. 
It is triggered when you push changes to the branch that is configured to publish your GitHub 
Pages site (usually gh-pages or main).

You can find more information about GitHub Pages and the pages-build-deployment action in
the GitHub Pages documentation.
